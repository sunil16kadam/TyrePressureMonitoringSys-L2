1. TPMS Monitoring Statechart Diagram
    States:
        Idle: The system is initialized but not monitoring.
        Monitoring: The system is actively monitoring tyre data.
        Logging: The system logs the data to a file.
        Error: The system detects an error (e.g., failure to access sensors or file).
        Data Logging State: Handles logging of tyre data while the system monitors.

    Transitions:

        1) System power on to Idle:
            Upon Entry: Display menu.
                        Wait for 'start' command.
            Upon Exit:  None
            Events to handle: start

        2) From Idle to Monitoring: When user issues 'start' command to starts monitoring 
            Upon Entry: start monitoring, i.e. 
                        Acquire data, 
                        Store in local buffer
            Upon Exit:  stop monitoring
            Events to handle: stop, log

        3) From Monitoring to Logging: After a fixed interval
            Upon Entry: start logging
            Upon Exit:  None
            Events to handle: None (Null transition to Montoring state)
       
        4) From Logging back to Monitoring: After successfully logging the data.
            Upon Entry: start monitoring, i.e. 
                        Acquire data, 
                        Store in local buffer
            Upon Exit:  stop monitoring
            Events to handle: stop, log
        
        5) From any state to Error: On encountering an exception (e.g., file access error).
            Upon Entry: Take steps to recover
            Upon Exit:  None
            Events to handle: receover
        
        6) From Error to Idle: After resolving the issue.
            Upon Entry: Display menu.
                        Wait for 'start' command.
            Upon Exit:  None
            Events to handle: start

    In any state, if event other than those allowed are received, system goes Error state
    I.e. system goes to Error state when
        a) In any state, if event other than those allowed are received, system goes Error state
        b) On encountering an exception, Examples coule be -
            - File access error
            - Connection failure
            - Sensor error (or while reading the sensor data)

2. User Interface Statechart Diagram (Future enhancement)
    States:
        Idle: The menu is displayed.
        Waiting for Input: Awaiting user input for a command.
        Processing Command: Executing the user command (e.g., start or stop monitoring).
        Exiting: Termination of the application.
    Transitions:
        From Idle to Waiting for Input: When the menu is displayed.
        From Waiting for Input to Processing Command: After the user selects an option.
        From Processing Command to Idle: After executing the command.
        From Idle to Exiting: When the user chooses to exit.

3. Tyre Sensor Statechart Diagram (Future enhancement)
    States:
        Inactive: The sensor is not being polled.
        Reading Data: The sensor generates tyre data (pressure and temperature).
        Data Ready: The data is available for processing.
    Transitions:
        From Inactive to Reading Data: When the monitoring system requests data.
        From Reading Data to Data Ready: When the data generation is complete.
        From Data Ready to Inactive: After data is processed by the system.

Key Features
    State Design Pattern: Each state is encapsulated in a class (IdleState, MonitoringState).
    Dynamic State Transition: TPMS dynamically switches between states based on events.
    Modularity: Each state has its own behavior, making the system easy to extend and maintain.
    Scalability: Adding new states (e.g., ErrorState) is straightforward.


*****************************************************************************************
Working of the syste:
*****************************************************************************************

Driver is an Actor, external to the system. In this case, it is Client function main().

Client builds the tpms system. (I.e. instantiate TPMS)
    [TPMS is designed to go through state machine.
    From the base class "State", derived states are "Idle", "Monitoring", "Logging" and "Error".
    TPMS maintains a pointer "currentState" which is of type State* (I.e. Base*).
    This is necessary for runtime polymorphism.]
tpms now goes to Idle state. I.e. currentState now starts pointing to Idle state.

Client is now ready to either send event to different objects in the system or exit the system.
Event is the command, either start or stop or log or recover or exit.
The only acceptable command when tpms is in Idle state is "start" or "exit".
Upon "exit" request, client exits the program.
Upon "start" command, Client request tpms to handle the event ("start"). 
I.e. client request tpms to start the system.
tpms state changes from "Idle" to "Monitoring".

tpms upon entering into "monitoring" state, performs two things.
1) It enters into monitoring state and starts monitoring.
2) It starts a Lambda thread (unnamed) which runs every fixed T interval.

    (1) As a part of monitoring, tpms spawns a thread "dataThread".
    This thread start acquiring sensor data i.e. tyre pressure for all the 4 tyres.
    This data is stored in local vector 'tyreData'.
    datathread runs continuously (since it is detached) in addition to main thread.
    main thread continues to accept the command , either start or stop or log or recover or exit.

    (2) Unnamed Lambda threads changes the state of tpms from "monitoring" to "log".
    and request tpms to handle this "log" event.
    
tpms checks allowed events [stop or log] in "monitoringring" state which is its currentState.
Upon receiving "stop" event,
    enters into "Idle" state.

Upon receiving "log" event,
    enters into "logging" state.
    logs the 'tyreData' into a file 'TyreData.log' 

Upon receiving Invalid event or exception, 
    enters into "Error" state.
    In the "Error" state, tpms expects only "receover" command i.e. event.
    Upon receiving "recover" event, tpms enter into "Idle" state.


*****************************************************************************************
Thread management :
*****************************************************************************************
    1) dataThread 
        Purpose: Reads data from sensor and store in local buffer
        When created: When tpms enters into Monitoring state
        When destroyed: When tpms exit from Monitoring state
        Frequence: 1 sec

    2) logThread
        Purpose: Reads data from local buffer and write to logfile TyreData.log
        When created: When tpms is instantiated
        When destroyed: When tpms is destroyed
        Frequence: 5 sec

Flags to control thread execution:
    Individual flags for each tread
    Data type: std::atomic<bool>
    
    1) flag_data_sensing_thread_running:
        Working:    ReSet when tpms is instantiated
                    set when dataThread is created
        Purpsoe:
            Do not recreate dataThread when this flag is already set   
            dataThread to keep reading sensor data as long as this flag is set  
            Stop monitoring only when this flag is set       
    
    2) flag_data_logger_thread_running:       
        Working:    Set when tpms is instantiated
                    Reset when 
                        a) tpms is destroyed, 
                        b) exception during data read from sensor, 
                        c) monitoring is stopped (transition from Monitoring to Idle/Logging state)
        Purpose:
            logThread keeps logging the data to file as long as this flag is set
            While logging the data, at any point if this flag is found reset, stop logging.

Life cycle of dataThread and logThread:
***************************************

When tpms is instantiated, 
    reset data_sensing_thread_running
    Set the flag flag_data_logger_thread_running
    Create logThread with thread function loggingTask

When tpms is destroyed, 
    When tpms is instantiated, 
        Reset the flag flag_data_logger_thread_running

State machien for tpms
*****************************************************************************************

When tpms transits from Idle to Monitoring state, tpms start monitoring.
    If data_sensing_thread_running is false, 
        Create dataThread 
        data_sensing_thread_running = true

    Actions in dataThread:    
        Read sensor data and store in local buffer "tyreData"
        access to tyreData is safeguarded using mutex_tyre_data

    If data_sensing_thread_running is true, it means thread is already running.
        In this case, do not create duplicate dataThread and simply return.

When tpms transits from Monitoring to Idle state (stop command),
    While exiting from Monitoring state,
        reset data_sensing_thread_running 
        dataThread is made to joined. dataThread ends now. 

When tpms transits from Monitoring to Logging state (log command),
    While exiting from Monitoring state,
        reset data_sensing_thread_running 
        dataThread is made to joined. dataThread ends now. 
        
    tpms logs data from tyreData buffer to file TyreData.log
    tpms enters into "monitoring" state again (automatically, when logging is over)



*****************************************************************************************

Key Features
    Error Handling: The ErrorState allows recovery from system faults or exceptions.
    Data Logging State: Handles dedicated logging actions, separating it from monitoring behavior.
    User Commands: Added commands for logging and recovery, enhancing interactivity.
    Future Extensibility: Adding states like MaintenanceState or DiagnosticState is straightforward.


In the above implementation, std::shared_ptr is used to manage the states of the Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). Here's why it is appropriate in this context:

1. Shared Ownership
Each State object is shared between the TPMS system and its current logic. The std::shared_ptr allows multiple parts of the program (like the TPMS class and potentially other modules) to reference the same state object.
For example, if the TPMS transitions to a new state, the old state object is safely destroyed when no other references exist.
2. Automatic Memory Management
By using std::shared_ptr, we don't need to manually manage the lifecycle of State objects (like explicitly delete-ing them). When no std::shared_ptr instances reference a particular State object, it is automatically deallocated.
This ensures RAII principles are adhered to, preventing resource leaks.
3. Safe Transitions Between States
During a state transition (setState function), the std::shared_ptr safely manages the current state:
The current state is replaced with a new state (std::make_shared).
The reference count of the old state decreases, and it is deleted if no references remain.
This avoids dangling pointers or undefined behavior, which might occur with raw pointers.
4. Exception Safety
The use of std::shared_ptr provides robust exception safety. If an exception is thrown during state transitions, the shared_ptr will correctly clean up the state objects, ensuring that resources are not leaked.
5. Flexibility for Future Features
Using std::shared_ptr allows additional flexibility if states need to be shared or accessed elsewhere in the system.
For example, if a debugging system or logger needs to access the current state, it can safely acquire a shared_ptr to the state without worrying about its validity.
Future extensions (like saving and restoring state information) are easier with shared_ptr compared to raw or unique pointers.

Draft notes below.
*****************************************************************************************

Why Not std::unique_ptr?
While std::unique_ptr is another smart pointer that would also work here (since there is typically only one owner of the state at a time), the primary reasons for using std::shared_ptr instead are:

Ease of State Transitions: During a state transition, the old state may still be referenced while transitioning to a new one. std::shared_ptr handles this gracefully.
Potential for Multiple Owners: If future requirements include having multiple components (like monitoring modules, logging systems, etc.) reference the same state, std::shared_ptr provides a natural mechanism for shared ownership.
When Should std::unique_ptr Be Used Instead?
If the states are strictly owned by the TPMS system, and no other component requires access, then std::unique_ptr would suffice. In that case:

The setState function would std::move the unique_ptr to transfer ownership.
The implementation would be slightly more lightweight and may avoid the overhead of reference counting.


Here’s how the implementation would look if we used std::unique_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr to manage state objects. This approach assumes that each state is strictly owned by the TPMS system, and no other component needs to share ownership of state objects.

Updated Code with std::unique_ptr
State.h
No changes needed here. State remains an abstract base class.

#ifndef STATE_H
#define STATE_H

#include <string>

class TPMS;

class State {
public:
    virtual ~State() = default;
    virtual void enter(TPMS& tpms) = 0;
    virtual void exit(TPMS& tpms) = 0;
    virtual void handleEvent(TPMS& tpms, const std::string& event) = 0;
};

#endif // STATE_H
IdleState.h
No changes; same for all other State subclasses.

IdleState.cpp
No changes in the logic; the usage of unique_ptr is reflected in TPMS management instead.

TPMS.h
We replace std::shared_ptr with std::unique_ptr for managing the current state.

#ifndef TPMS_H
#define TPMS_H

#include "State.h"
#include <memory> // For std::unique_ptr

class TPMS {
public:
    TPMS();
    void setState(std::unique_ptr<State> newState);
    void handleEvent(const std::string& event);
    void startMonitoring();
    void stopMonitoring();
    void startLogging();
    void handleError();

private:
    std::unique_ptr<State> currentState;
};

#endif // TPMS_H
TPMS.cpp
The main difference is how states are created and transitioned using std::unique_ptr.

#include "TPMS.h"
#include "IdleState.h"
#include "MonitoringState.h"
#include "LoggingState.h"
#include "ErrorState.h"
#include <iostream>

TPMS::TPMS() {
    currentState = std::make_unique<IdleState>();
    currentState->enter(*this);
}

void TPMS::setState(std::unique_ptr<State> newState) {
    currentState->exit(*this); // Exit the current state
    currentState = std::move(newState); // Transfer ownership of the new state
    currentState->enter(*this); // Enter the new state
}

void TPMS::handleEvent(const std::string& event) {
    currentState->handleEvent(*this, event);
}

void TPMS::startMonitoring() {
    std::cout << "TPMS started monitoring tyres." << std::endl;
    // Add monitoring logic (e.g., spawn threads to collect data)
}

void TPMS::stopMonitoring() {
    std::cout << "TPMS stopped monitoring tyres." << std::endl;
    // Add logic to stop monitoring
}

void TPMS::startLogging() {
    std::cout << "Logging tyre data..." << std::endl;
    // Implement logging functionality
}

void TPMS::handleError() {
    std::cout << "Error encountered! Switching to Error State." << std::endl;
    setState(std::make_unique<ErrorState>());
}
State Transitions
When transitioning states, the new state is created using std::make_unique and passed to the setState function. For example, here's how transitions are handled in the IdleState and MonitoringState.

IdleState.cpp

#include "IdleState.h"
#include "TPMS.h"
#include "MonitoringState.h"

void IdleState::enter(TPMS& tpms) {
    std::cout << "Entering Idle State." << std::endl;
}

void IdleState::exit(TPMS& tpms) {
    std::cout << "Exiting Idle State." << std::endl;
}

void IdleState::handleEvent(TPMS& tpms, const std::string& event) {
    if (event == "start") {
        tpms.setState(std::make_unique<MonitoringState>()); // Transition to MonitoringState
    } else {
        std::cout << "Invalid event in Idle State." << std::endl;
    }
}

MonitoringState.cpp
#include "MonitoringState.h"
#include "TPMS.h"
#include "IdleState.h"

void MonitoringState::enter(TPMS& tpms) {
    std::cout << "Entering Monitoring State." << std::endl;
    tpms.startMonitoring();
}

void MonitoringState::exit(TPMS& tpms) {
    std::cout << "Exiting Monitoring State." << std::endl;
    tpms.stopMonitoring();
}

void MonitoringState::handleEvent(TPMS& tpms, const std::string& event) {
    if (event == "stop") {
        tpms.setState(std::make_unique<IdleState>()); // Transition to IdleState
    } else {
        std::cout << "Invalid event in Monitoring State." << std::endl;
    }
}

Main Function
No changes are needed here. The main.cpp file remains the same.

Why Use std::unique_ptr in This Case?
Exclusive Ownership: Each state is exclusively owned by the TPMS object, making std::unique_ptr the natural choice.
Lighter Overhead: std::unique_ptr is more lightweight than std::shared_ptr because it does not maintain a reference count.
Automatic Resource Management: Just like std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr ensures proper cleanup when the pointer goes out of scope.
Clear Ownership Semantics: By using std::unique_ptr, the ownership and lifecycle of each state object are unambiguous.
